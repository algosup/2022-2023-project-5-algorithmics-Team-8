Start of the project: 02/05/2023

End of the project: 23/06/2023

## Overview

The project is an algorithm that will be able to make instructions for the blending process of a champagne company, Krug Champagne.

The algorithm will take as input a list of wines and their respective quantities and will output a list of instructions for the blending of the wines.

The project will be made in C++ and will be cross-compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
