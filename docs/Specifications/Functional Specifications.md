## Overview

### Context

Krug Champagne will open a new winery. They want to hasten and renew the process of blending the wine.
They want to create software that will calculate the blending steps for them.
We know that there are 300 tanks available, and we know that the blending can call for more than 400 wines in the process.

### Client

Krug Champagne (part of LVMH)

### Evaluation criteria

The software will be evaluated on correctness, how close the final product is to the wanted formula, comments and idiomatic style, the minimum number of steps to get to the result, the speed of the code, and whether the result does not contain any critical errors.

### What is Krug Champagne?

Krug Champagne is a French champagne house founded by Joseph Krug in 1843. It is based principally in Reims, the main city in France's Champagne region, and is one of the famous Champagne houses that formed part of the Grande Marques.

#### How does making champagne work?

- 1) Harvesting: The grapes used to make champagne are typically harvested in September or October. The most commonly used grape varieties are Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay.

- 2) Pressing: The grapes are pressed gently to extract the juice, which is then stored in tanks or barrels for fermentation.

- 3) First Fermentation: The first fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks or oak barrels. Yeast is added to the juice, which converts the sugar into alcohol. This process takes about two weeks, and it produces a still wine with low alcohol content.

`________________________Project Scope_____________________________`

- 4) Blending: The still wines from different vineyards and grape varieties are blended to create a consistent flavor profile.

`________________________End of Scope_____________________________`

- 5) Second Fermentation: The blended wine is bottled, and a mixture of sugar and yeast is added to it. The bottles are then sealed with a crown cap and stored horizontally in cool, dark cellars. The second fermentation takes place in the bottle, and the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast is trapped in the wine, creating bubbles.

- 6) Aging: The bottles are aged on their lees (the dead yeast cells) for at least 15 months for non-vintage champagne, and at least three years for vintage champagne. During this time, the wine develops complex flavors and aromas.

- 7) Riddling: After aging, the bottles are gradually rotated and tilted to move the lees towards the neck of the bottle. This process is called riddling, and it is done manually or using a machine.

- 8) Disgorgement: Once the lees have settled in the neck of the bottle, the bottles are opened, and the frozen plug of lees is removed. This process is called disgorgement.

- 9) Dosage: After disgorgement, a mixture of wine and sugar (known as the dosage) is added to the champagne to adjust its sweetness level. The bottles are then corked, wired, and labeled.

### Why automate the process?

The blending process is a very important step in the production of champagne. It is a complex process that requires a lot of time and expertise. The blending process is done by a team of experts who taste the wine and decide which wines to blend to create the final product.

They then need to reproduce the same blend on a large scale, which is a very difficult task because the process is lossy and the wine is not always the same when done by hand.

A good algorithm will get the final champagne closer to the real recipe. It will end up tasting better and being more consistent.

### Hardware minimum

Windows

- minimum of 2GB of RAM
- minimum of 10Mo of free disk space

### Language selected, Why CPP?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

C++ is fast and efficient, and it provides a lot of control over the hardware, which makes it a good choice for systems programming and embedded systems. It is also a good choice for applications that require high performance.

C++ is supported by a large number of libraries, which makes it easy to write portable code. It is also supported by a large number of tools, including compilers, debuggers, and profilers.

C++ is one of the fastest programming languages because it is compiled directly into machine code.

### Why compiled program?

Compiled programs are faster than interpreted programs because they are translated into machine code before they are executed. This means that the program does not need to be translated each time it is executed, which saves time.

With a compiled program, the client does not need to have the source code, which means that the client does not need to have a compiler installed on their computer.

## Audience

The audience of the solution is the team of experts who are responsible for the blending process. They are the ones who will use the software to create the blending steps.

The audience does not need to know any particular software.

## What is the problem

The blending process is a very important step in the production of champagne. It is a complex process that requires a lot of time and expertise. The blending process is done by a team of experts who taste the wine and decide which wines to blend to create the final product. When applying the blending process to a large scale, the team of experts needs to reproduce the same blend on a large scale, which is a very difficult task because the process is lossy and the wine is not always the same when done by hand.

## Laws and regulations

There are no laws or regulations that apply to this project.

AOP which is the main problem of the champagne industry is not a problem for the software since the software does not impact the source of the wine.

## Ressources

Since the champagne industry is in France because of the [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d%27origine_prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9e), most of our resources are in French.

## Requirements

The Software needs to be focused on :

- never partially filling tanks
- never overfilling tanks
- minimizing the number of tanks used
- minimizing the number of transfers between tanks
- The closest result to the target blend
- The software needs to be able to intake config files containing the data of the wine, tank sizes, and the percentage to take from each type of wine and the choosen number of hectoliters to produce.
- The software needs to be able to output a file containing the blending steps.

## Functionalities

### Must have

- A Documentation explaining how to use the software.
- A config file example ready to be filled
- The software needs to be able to intake config files containing the data of the wine, tank sizes, and the percentage to take from each type of wine and the choosen number of hectoliters to produce.
- The software needs to be able to calculate the blending steps.
- The software needs to be able to output a file containing the blending steps.
- Development API oriented 

### Out of scope

- There will be Graphical User Interface (GUI) will be provided, and the software will be a console application.
- The software will not be dynamically updating the result if the data changes, the user will have to re-run the software to get the new result.
- The software will not be able to intake any other file formatting other than the one provided.
- The software will not support hardware older than Windows 7, we will not support older versions of CPP.

### Compatibility

- The software needs to be compatible with Windows 7 minimum and We should extend to as many of the following platforms as possible:
- Windows
- Mac OS
- Linux

### Documentation

The software needs to be heavily documented, we need to make sure that anyone can understand how to use it.
The clients are not supposed to have any real technical knowledge, so we need to make sure that the documentation is easy to understand.

The customer is French, so the documentation needs to be in French.

### Testing

The software needs to be tested thoroughly, we need to make sure that the software is working as intended and that it does not contain any critical errors.

The QA will be in charge of testing the software, he will be using the documentation to test the software.

We will use Google test to test the software as well as TDD in the development process.

## Cost analysis

The cost of the project is the time spent on it, the project is not supposed to be sold, so there is no cost of production.

### Human Resources

The project is supposed to be developed by 5 people, and each person will be spending around 10 hours per week on the project, so the total cost of the project is 50 hours per week.

The project is supposed to be developed during 9 weeks, so the total cost of the project is 450 hours or per person 90 hours.

## Privacy

The software will not be storing any data, so there is no privacy concern.
No internet connection is required to use the software.

The project does not require any internet connection and is just going to use local files.

## Non-functional requirements

### Security

The project is not supposed to be used by anyone outside of the company, so there is no security concern.

We only access the files prepared for the use of the software, so there is no security concern about taking data from the disk.

### Usability

The software needs to be easy to use, we need to make sure that the user can understand how to use it even if not required.

The software should adapt to the most common use cases, since the software should be used once per year, we need to focus more on the performance than the GUI or the UX.

The software will be a console application, so it will not have any GUI.

It might be time-consuming to use the software if the input is not already made, but it is not a problem since the software is only supposed to be used once per year.

### Maintainability

The software should not need to be adapted since the industry of wine is stable and does not change much.
The software is supposed to be used once per year, there are little to no changes at all in the industry of wine.

### Scalability

The software needs to be able to handle large amounts of data easily and fast.

## Risks and assumptions

The main risks are:

- The software is not used by the clients because it is too complicated to use
- The software is not used by the clients because it does not hasten the process
- The software misinterprets the data
- The software is not well documented and is confusing for the user,
- The software creates memory leaks and other memory-related issues during the execution of the program.
- The software uses outdated technologies and encounters critical issues during the execution of the program.

With all of these concerns, the software might miss the deadline or fall out of use.

To prevent this from happening, we need to make sure that the software is well documented and that the software is tested thoroughly throughout the development process.

### Development environment

The software will be developed only on Mac OS M1, we will use version 11 of CPP.
It is a console application so any editor will work.

| Technology | Version |
| --- | --- |
| CPP | 11 |
| Bazel | 6.11 |
| google test | 1.12.0 |

We try to use the longest LTS possible to make sure that the software is not outdated.

### What is Bazel?

Bazel is a build system that is used to build C++ projects. It is similar to CMake, but it is more modern and it is easier to use.
It is the compiler used with the Google test.

Bazel allows cross-platform compilation, so it is a good choice for this project since we want to support as many platforms as possible without having to change the code.

### What is Google Test?

Google Test is a unit testing library for the C++ programming language, based on the xUnit architecture. The library is released under the BSD 3-clause license.
It will help to automate the testing process.

### CPP Evolution

The software will be developed using the latest version of CPP, we will use version 11 of CPP because it is the latest version of CPP and it is the version that supports the most features.
CPP is an old language, so it is not supposed to change much in the future.
If the language changes, the code will still work.

## Success criteria

The software will be considered a success if it meets the [requirements](#requirements) and the minimum [functionalities](#functionalities) of the project.

We aim to adapt to the client as much as possible.

## Out of scope

The software will not support hardware older than Windows 7, we will not support older versions of CPP.

If the process does not follow the documentation, no troubleshooting will be done by the software to try to tamper with the data to make it work.

The software will not be dynamically updating the result if the data changes, the user will have to re-run the software to get the new result.

- **LVMH**: LVMH Mo√É¬´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, also known as LVMH, is a French multinational corporation and conglomerate specializing in luxury goods, headquartered in Paris, France. The company was formed in 1987 under the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with Mo√É¬´t Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 merger between the champagne producer Mo√É¬´t & Chandon and Hennessy, the cognac manufacturer.

- **Krug Champagne**: Krug Champagne is a French champagne house founded by Joseph Krug in 1843. It is based principally in Reims, the main city in France's Champagne region, and is one of the famous Champagne houses that formed part of the Grande Marques.

- **Champagne**: Champagne is a sparkling wine produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region. Some use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine, but in many countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.

- **Tank**: A tank is a large container for holding liquids or gases.

- **AOP**: An Appellation d'Origine Prot√É¬©g√É¬©e is a geographical indication used to identify products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. In the European Union, the use of the term AOP is legally protected and can only be used where the product meets the criteria laid down in the law.

- **TDD**: Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases being created later.

- **GUI**: A graphical user interface is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

- **machine code**: Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.

- **LTS**: Long-term support is a product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the standard edition. The term is usually reserved for desktop operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. LTS is typically marketed to businesses as well as educational and scientific institutions that rely heavily on stable systems and software.
