# Meeting Group 5 report 10-05-2023

As group 8 we did a meeting with group 5, the meeting took place on the 10th of May 2023 at 10.45, the meeting lasted 15 minutes. 

## Overview

During this meeting, group 5 commented on our functional specifications and presented their technical specifications, we agreed on some changes that needed to be made to our functional specifications and we agreed on their starting point for the technical specifications, we will review them further during our next project time. 

Key points of the meeting:
- A bit more details are required about our functional specifications
- No mentions of the UI in the specifications
- No mentions of the .config file

Need to be changed in our functional specifications:
- Remove explanation about .csv.
- Precise that we are talking about a console app
- Talk about GitHub pages
- Make an example of the .config


## Why not .csv?

We decided to use a .config file instead, it is more time-consuming for the end user but they are going to modify it once every year the major advantage of a .config is that it allows us to have more control over the data and it is easier to use. 

## Why not a GUI? Why a console app? 

After reviewing our choices, discussing with the client, and studying our possibilities with a GUI we ended up deciding to restrict ourselves to a console app, as it is easier to implement, more reliable, and compatible with different operating systems. 

All of these points are what made us decide to go for a console app instead of a GUI. 

Instead, we are planning to make an API that will allow us to link the software to a GUI in the future after implementing the core functionalities.

## Why GitHub pages?

We want to have a deep and precise documentation for our project as it is going to be used by non-technical people, we want to make full documentation of the project easy to find and easy to read for the client, GitHub pages tend to be the best option for this case.

## .config example

After deciding to go from .csv to .config files we are going to make an example of a .config file and add it to our functional specifications.
