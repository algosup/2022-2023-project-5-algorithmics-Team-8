# Week 2 - Project Report 

## Overview

During the first day our Software Engineer studied different programming languages for our solutions and came up with C++ as the best option for numerous reasons:
- It is a compiled language, it can run on any platform without the need of an interpreter, it can run as a standalone executable.
- It is faster than most other programming languages
- It is a low level language, it allows us to have more control over the memory and the hardware
- Highly documented and supported
- Old and reliable language 
- Strong standard library

At the same time we sent functional specifications to group 5 and we are now waiting for an approval from them. Since we planned to send a mock-up of the input and output of the program the following day however group 5 is not in capacity to read it, we will be a little bit late on our schedule. We started other tasks instead.
