# Week 2 - Project Report 

## Overview

On the first day, our Software Engineer studied different programming languages for our solutions and came up with C++ as the best option for numerous reasons:
- It is a compiled language, it can run on any platform without the need for an interpreter, and it can run as a standalone executable.
- It is faster than most other programming languages
- It is a low-level language, it allows us to have more control over the memory and the hardware
- Highly documented and supported
- Old and reliable language
- Strong standard library

We sent group 5 our functional specifications, and they reviewed it and gave us quick feedback during a meeting, you can find more information [here](../meeting/Meeting%20Group%205%20report%2010-05-2023.md), now that we have changed some parts of our functional specifications we now need to wait for their technical specifications; during this time we will focus on tasks that do not require the technical specifications.

At the same time, we put our communication with the client in a document to keep track of the information and make sure that we have all the information we need.

Our QA initialized the repository and set up a GitHub actions workflow to run the tests on every push, it will ensure that the code is always working and that we do not break anything.

We fill the README.md with the information that we have so far, we will update it as we progress in the project.
