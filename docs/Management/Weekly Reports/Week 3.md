# Week 3 - Project Report 

## Overview

During this week, we officialy only have project time(3h30), because of that we focused on only a couple of tasks. 

## Tasks

One member did the research document, another one did a prototype of the algorithm and the last one finished documents such as RACI matrix and the project report.

We are still on time with the schedule, however we still need to wait for group 5 to finish their technical specifications to start the development of the project and re-use our prototype to build the end product.
