# Risks - Mitigation plan 

This document contains major risks that could affect the project and the mitigation plan to reduce the likelihood and impact of these risks, it will be updated as time goes on.

## Risks

### Risk 1: The algorithm does not produce consistent results.

This risk pertains to the possibility that the algorithm may produce different results for the same input data under different circumstances, which can lead to confusion, mistakes, and loss of trust in the system. One potential source of inconsistency could be the use of random or probabilistic functions in the algorithm that introduce variability into the outputs. Another possibility is that the algorithm relies on external resources, such as web services or databases, that are themselves subject to change or instability.

#### Mitigation plan 

To reduce the likelihood and impact of this risk, the following steps can be taken:

- Use deterministic algorithms wherever possible that will always produce the same output for a given input. This can be achieved through careful design and testing of the code to ensure that it does not rely on sources of randomness or other external factors that could affect the output. If probabilistic or random functions are necessary, they should be seeded with a fixed value to ensure repeatability.
- Document the expected outputs for different inputs and test cases, and verify that the actual outputs match the expected results. This can help catch inconsistencies early on and enable corrective action to be taken before they have serious consequences.
- Monitor the performance of any external resources that the algorithm relies on, and have backup plans in place in case of outages or other disruptions. If possible, use local copies of data or services to reduce dependence on external factors.
- Conduct thorough testing and validation of the algorithm under a range of conditions and scenarios, including edge cases and unusual inputs. This can help identify any unexpected sources of inconsistency and enable them to be addressed before they cause problems.

With these measures in place, we can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of the algorithm producing inconsistent results.

### Risk 2: The algorithm does not match the formula developed by the Cellar Master.

In this case, it can be due to different reasons:
- The cellar master did not input the right data and it did not trigger any error.
- The algorithm contains bugs during the input process and can come from:
 - The parser for the configuration file is not working properly. 
 - The algorithm is not checking the input data properly.

#### Mitigation plan

To mitigate the risk of the algorithm not matching the formula developed by the Cellar Master, we can implement the following mitigation plan:

- Develop a thorough testing plan to verify the algorithm's correctness and ensure that it matches the input formula.
- Conduct regular reviews and quality checks of the input data and formula provided by the Cellar Master.
- Implement robust error handling and exception handling mechanisms to ensure that the algorithm identifies and reports any discrepancies or errors in the input data.
- Use version control to keep track of changes made to the algorithm and input data, and ensure that any changes made are thoroughly tested before being deployed.
- Ensure that the algorithm is designed to be flexible and able to adapt to changes in the input data, such as changes to the grape varieties used or adjustments to the blending proportions.
- Provide regular training and support to the Cellar Master and other stakeholders involved in the project to ensure that they understand how the algorithm works and how to input data correctly.
- Establish a clear communication plan with the Cellar Master and other stakeholders to ensure that any issues or discrepancies are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.
- By implementing these mitigation strategies, we can reduce the likelihood of the algorithm not matching the formula developed by the Cellar Master and ensure that the project is completed successfully.

### Risk 3: The algorithm is not reliable.

The algorithm may not be reliable due to various reasons such as coding errors, incomplete or incorrect input data, or hardware malfunctions. Unreliable algorithms can result in incorrect predictions, leading to incorrect business decisions and losses.

#### Mitigation plan

To mitigate this risk, the following actions can be taken:

- Conduct a thorough review of the algorithm by a third party to identify any coding errors or loopholes.
- Conduct comprehensive testing of the algorithm with a diverse range of input data to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
- Implement regular maintenance and update protocols to ensure the algorithm stays reliable over time.
- Create a feedback mechanism to capture user feedback on algorithm accuracy, allowing quick identification of potential issues and opportunities for improvement.
- Ensure hardware is up-to-date and reliable to avoid issues with algorithm execution.
- By implementing these actions, the risk of an unreliable algorithm can be significantly reduced, improving the accuracy of the algorithm's predictions and the resulting business decisions.

### Risk 4: The algorithm is not easy to use.

Users may find the algorithm difficult to use, which could lead to user frustration and decreased adoption of the algorithm.

#### Mitigation plan:

- User interface design: A well-designed user interface can significantly improve the user experience and make the algorithm easier to use.
- User testing: Conducting user testing can help identify any usability issues and provide feedback for improvement.
- User documentation: Providing clear and concise documentation, such as a user manual or online help system, can help users understand how to use the algorithm effectively.
- Training: Providing training sessions or workshops can help users learn how to use the algorithm more efficiently and effectively.
- Continuous improvement: Continuously collecting feedback from users and making improvements based on their feedback can help improve the usability of the algorithm over time.
