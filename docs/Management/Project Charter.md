## Project Overview

### Problem statement

Krug Champagne requires an algorithm to help them gain time during the blending process for their new winery that is cost-effective and produces a consistent taste.

### Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm that helps Krug Champagne to blend wines for their new winery. The algorithm should be cost-effective and produce consistent results that match the formula developed by the Cellar Master while being reliable and easy to use.

### Business case

The new winery will provide Krug Champagne with the ability to produce a higher volume of champagne, which will help them to meet the growing demand for their product. A cost-effective algorithm will help the company save money and produce consistent results.

### Stakeholders 

Our stakeholders are Krug Champagne and especially the Cellar Master, who will be using the algorithm to blend wines for the new winery.

### Goals

- Develop an algorithm that blends wines for Krug Champagne's new winery.
- Produce consistent results that match the formula developed by the Cellar Master.
- Minimize the number of steps required to blend the wines.
- Ensure that the wines are never in contact with oxygen to prevent oxidation.

### Deliverables

- The algorithm that blends wines for Krug Champagne's new winery.
- Documentation of the algorithm, including code and comments.
- Test results showing that the algorithm produces consistent results.

## Project Scope

### In scope

- Developing an algorithm that blends wines for Krug Champagne's new winery.
- Producing consistent results that match the formula developed by the Cellar Master.
- Minimizing the number of steps required to blend the wines.
- Ensuring that the wines are never in contact with oxygen to prevent oxidation.

### Out of scope

- Checking the quality of the wines.
- Ensuring that the wines are not exposed to the oxygen in the air.
- Checking that what the user inputs are valid with what is in the tanks.
- Riddling and disgorgement processes.

### Tentative schedule

Week 1-2: Research and planning
Week 3-4: Algorithm development and testing
Week 5: Fine-tuning the algorithm based on test results
Week 6-7: Final testing and documentation
week 8: Final presentation

## Resources

### Project team

Théo Diancourt (Project Manager)
Louis de Lavenne de Choulot de Chabaud la Tour (Program Manager)
Maxime Pages (Quality Assurance)

### Support resources
Contact with the client

### Other resources
330 tanks of various sizes
Pumps and pipes to connect the tanks

## Cost estimates

The development of the algorithm will cost 0€.

### Benefits and customers

The algorithm will benefit Krug Champagne by allowing them to produce a higher volume of champagne while maintaining a consistent taste. The customers of Krug Champagne will benefit from being able to purchase champagne that is consistent in taste and quality.

Risks, constraints, and assumptions

### Risks

Difficulty in obtaining accurate taste data for the formula.
Technical challenges in developing the algorithm.

### Constraints

Tanks should never be left partially full to prevent oxidation.
The formula must be matched with minimal steps.
The algorithm must be cost-effective and produce consistent results.

### Assumptions

Sufficient data will be available to accurately match the formula.
Algorithm development will be completed within the estimated timeframe.
