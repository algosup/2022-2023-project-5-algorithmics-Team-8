# RACI - Matrix 

## What is RACI?

RACI is a matrix that describes the participation of different roles in a set of tasks or activities. The acronym RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

## How to read the matrix?

The matrix is divided into four columns, each of which represents a role. The rows represent the tasks or activities to be performed. The cells of the matrix are filled with the letters R, A, C, or I, depending on the role's participation in the task or activity.

- Responsible (R): The person who is responsible for completing the task or activity.
- Accountable (A): The person who is accountable for the task or activity. This is usually the person who has the authority to make decisions about the task or activity.
- Consulted (C): The person who is consulted about the task or activity. This person may provide input or advice but does not have the authority to make decisions.
- Informed (I): The person who is informed about the task or activity. This person may need to be kept up-to-date on progress but does not need to be consulted or involved in decision-making.
- Not Applicable (N/A): The task or activity does not apply to the role.
