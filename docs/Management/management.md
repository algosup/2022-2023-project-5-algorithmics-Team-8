We are going to work with them to build 2 projects, one for each group.

We will provide them with functional specifications and they are going to provide us technical specifications.

## Project Management

### Tools 

Our main tool to manage the project is GitHub projects.

### GitHub Projects

- [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/12/views/1) to manage the tasks and the roadmap

The GitHub project is divided into 5 columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| To do | Tasks that are not yet started |
| In progress | Tasks that are in progress |
| Done | Tasks that are done |
| Continuously updated | Tasks that are continuously updated |
| On hold | Tasks that cannot be done before another task is done |

### Milestones

We have 3 milestones:

- Documents(week 2)
- Prototype(week 4)
- Final product(week 8)

#### Documents

The documents milestone contains all the documents that are needed for the project such as specifications, research, etc.

All templates and initial documents needed for the project are due by the end of week 2.

You can find the documents in the [docs](../../docs/) folder.

#### Prototype

The prototype milestone refers to the prototype of the algorithm that will be used to build the final product.

It is due at the end of week 4.

It will then be debugged and improved until the end of week 6 to be ready for the final product. 

#### Final product

The final product milestone refers to the final product that will be delivered to the client.

It is due for the end of week 8 (end of the project).

It needs to be tested and debugged, with an official GitHub release, a user guide, etc. 

### Schedule

Each project time is 3h30 long with a 15-minute break in the middle.

We will not take into account the time spent on the project outside of the project time.

Week 1: 3 half days (10h30)
Week 2: 7 half days (24h30)
Week 3: 1 half-day (3h30)
Week 4: 5 half days (17h30)
